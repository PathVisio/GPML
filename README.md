# GPML
Graphical Pathway Markup Language

Release planning, ongoing developments and feature requests

Directory "test" contains a variety of GPML files to serve as an acid test for GPML parsing and handling libraries (inspired by [csv-spectrum](https://github.com/maxogden/csv-spectrum)).

The GPML2013a-fuller schema was never used in PathVisio-Java, but it more accurately and fully reflects the GPML used from 2013 to 2017 than does the GPML2013a schema. Both the GPML2013a and GPML2013a-fuller schemas attempt to describe the exact same GPML.
